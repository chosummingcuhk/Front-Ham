The game is called front ham. Create python code for the game to be used for reinforcement learning. The rules are as follows.
It consists of 5 players, with 5 corresponding colors.
There are 6 socks hung on a clothes line for each of the 5 colors.
Each player only knows their own color, and does not know the colors corresponding to the others.
Each player has to take 3 socks off and put 1 sock on. There are no restrictions on the colors of the socks taken off and put on, except that the socks have to be of 1 of the 5 colors.
If there are no socks of a color remaining on the clothes line, the player corresponding to that color is eliminated.
This is repeated until there is only one standing.
Handle eliminations after a player has done all their moves, except for the final round where two players remain.
In that case, if the sock count reaches zero at any point, the player is eliminated.
Players cannot be revived unless the sock count goes from 1 to 0 then to 1 during one round due to a player taking off and putting on a sock of the same color.
Make the code more conducive to RL by creating an API of some sort to allow agents to observe the game state and choose actions.
